## Study Plan to Learn Rocket Science

## Introduction
We'll create an interactive web application using Flask that serves as a study plan for learning rocket science. This application will provide users with an organized structure to progress in their study of rocket science.

### HTML Files

1. **index.html:**
   - Serves as the homepage.
   - Provides an overview of the study plan, including the overall structure and major topics.
   - Links to individual topic pages and assessment pages.

2. **topics.html:**
   - Lists all the topics covered in the study plan.
   - Displays each topic's name and a brief description.
   - Links to individual topic pages.

3. **topic.html:**
   - Displays the details of a specific topic.
   - Includes subsections for theory, practice, and assessment.
   - Provides links to resources, such as books, articles, and videos.

4. **assessments.html:**
   - Lists all the assessments included in the study plan.

   - Provides instructions on taking the assessment and a link to the actual assessment.

### Routes

1. **Homepage:** '/'
   - Renders the `index.html` file.

2. **Topics:** '/topics'
   - Renders the `topics.html` file.

3. **Topic Details:** '/topic/<topic_id>'
   - Renders the `topic.html` file with the specified topic's details.

4. **Assessments:** '/assessments'
   - Renders the `assessments.html` file.

5. **Assessment Details:** '/assessment/<assessment_id>'
   - Renders the `assessment.html` file with the specified assessment's details.

This Flask application provides a structured and accessible way to learn rocket science. Users can navigate through the study plan, access topic details, and take assessments to monitor their progress.
